## Introduction

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Unix systems. I strive for efficiency, simplicity and some aesthetics if it's simple enough.

If you are here for my old bspwm, wayfire, sway or river setups you can find it [here](https://github.com/speyll/misc-dotfiles).

## Software Used

  - mainly `labwc` & `wayfire` and somtimes `sway` as window managers (compositors).
  - `foot` Terminal emulator.
  - ~~`yambar`~~ `waybar` Status bar.
  - `fuzzel` The application launcher menu.
  - `pipewire` Audio server.
  - `grim` For taking screenshots.
  - `slurp` To select regions for screenshot capture.
  - `brightnessctl` Tool to control screen brightness.
  - `wlsunset` For managing night mode settings.
  - `wl-clipboard` For clipboard management.
  - `cliphist` To access clipboard history.
  - `imv` My image viewer.
  - `fnott` Notification system.
  - `mpv` Video player.
  - `nvim` & `nano` Text editor
  - `noto-fonts-emoji`, `noto-fonts-ttf`, `noto-fonts-cjk`,`nerd-fonts-symbols-ttf`, `cascadia-mono` Fonts.
  - `flavours` For setting base16 colors pretty much everywhere.

If you're interested in a comprehensive list of packages, check out my post-install script for Void Linux, which sets up a highly efficient system. The script is well-documented and available [here](https://gist.github.com/Speyll/b2c46449fb9a9be44f07be3a81f01a2b).

For those on a Systemd distro, I also have a script tailored for Debian. While it's Debian-specific, it can provide insight into configuring other systemd distros. You can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/Speyll/852a81e28565a7dca2777a78da36eaa9).

## Special Keybinds

- `Mod + Enter`: Open terminal (foot)
- `Mod + D`: Launch menu selector (fuzzel)
- `Mod + Shift + Q` or `Alt + F4`: Close focused window
- `Mod + Shift + S`: Take screenshot of selected area (slurp + grim)
- `Impr Screen`: Capture entire screen
- `Mod + Comma`: Access clipboard selector
- `Mod + Semicolon`: Open emoji selector

Note: I use an **AZERTY** keyboard, so some keybindings may differ. For example, workspace switching may not use numbers, and window closing may require `Mod + Shift + A` instead of `Q`. Similarly, the **emoji selector** may be triggered by `Mod + M` instead of semicolon, if you use a QWERTY Keyboard you might want to modify that before.

## Special Scripts

I've crafted special scripts to simplify environment variable setup for both Labwc and Sway. These scripts streamline the process of launching your preferred window manager with the right configurations.

- `start-wayfire`: Use this script to launch Wayfire with the configured environment variables.
- `start-labwc`: Use this script to launch Labwc with the configured environment variables.
- `start-sway`: Use this script to launch Sway with the appropriate configurations.

Additionally, there are other handy scripts available in `.local/bin`
